                        <p>So that we can ensure smooth transaction, it is important to understand the terms and conditions:</p>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Payment Process</h4>
                            <p>Once we receive all your information, we work quickly to verify your account. Sometimes, we may need to call you in order to complete verification. Once verified, payment will be issued via PayPal within the same business day. Please note: PayPal deducts a 2.9 percent fee.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>What do we do:</h4>
                            <p>1. Once we purchase your airline miles, your miles will then be used towards redemptions of airline tickets. In other words, your account will be used to book airline tickets for third party passengers. You may receive emails regarding the redemption. Should you have any questions, please forward them to our office.</p>
                            <p>2. Please note that we reserve the right to access the account until the ticket has been utilized (or the passenger has flown and returned).</p>
                            <p>3. We will only use the amount of miles or points we purchased, even if the account accrued more miles in the meantime.</p>
                            <p>4. We may also need to add miles in order to book a ticket if the account does not have enough miles. The additional miles belong to us as well and we only add them before booking if necessary.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>What you should do / Or Not do:</h4>
                            <p>As you are aware, even though legal, selling of miles and points are against the terms and conditions of the airlines. Therefore, information should not be volunteered about the sale. If you have any questions, you may email us at <strong>info@sellmiles.com</strong>.</p>
